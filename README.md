# Connect Four game made with C++

- I used OOP concepts such as Aggregation, Composition, Inheritance, and Polymorphism to implement this program.
- It allows two players to take turns to play a match, and at the end the winner is declared with their favorite adjective!
- It supports two game modes: 1. 1v1 Mode (Two Players) 2. Tournament Mode (Four Players)
- Hope you enjoy playing it! :D
